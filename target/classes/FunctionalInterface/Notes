//Syntax of lambda expression
(parameter_list) -> {function_body}

Lambda expression vs method in Java
A method (or function) in Java has these main parts:
1. Name
2. Parameter list
3. Body
4. return type.

A lambda expression in Java has these main parts:
Lambda expression only has body and parameter list.
1. No name – function is anonymous so we don’t care about the name
2. Parameter list
3. Body – This is the main part of the function.
4. No return type – The java 8 compiler is able to infer the return type by checking the code. you need not to mention it explicitly.

Where to use the Lambdas in Java
To use lambda expression, you need to either create your own functional interface or use the pre defined functional interface provided by Java. 
An interface with only single abstract method is called functional interface(or Single Abstract method interface), for example: Runnable, callable, ActionListener etc.

 Functional Interface is special interface having only one abstract method in it. All are available in java.util.function package.
It can be written with @FunctionalInterface annotation also.
